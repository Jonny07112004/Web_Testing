# Web_Testing

A comprehensive, hands-on repository focused on web application penetration testing, designed to demonstrate practical offensive security skills used in real-world environments. This project covers end-to-end web security assessment workflows—from reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery to exploitation and remediation reporting—mapped closely to OWASP Top 10 and industry best practices.

Key Highlights

Web Application Reconnaissance

Subdomain enumeration, technology fingerprinting, and attack surface mapping

Vulnerability Identification & Exploitation

SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, SSRF, Command Injection, File Upload vulnerabilities

Authentication & Authorization Testing

Broken access control, session management flaws, privilege escalation

Automated + Manual Testing

Tool-based scanning (Burp Suite, Nmap, Nikto) combined with manual exploitation

Secure Coding & Mitigation

Proof-of-concept exploits with remediation guidance

Documentation-Driven Approach

Clear attack scenarios, payloads, screenshots, and security recommendations

Tools & Technologies

Burp Suite, Nmap, Nikto, SQLmap

Python & Bash for custom scripts

OWASP ZAP

Linux (Kali/Ubuntu)

HTTP/HTTPS, REST APIs

Learning Outcomes

Understand real-world web attack vectors
