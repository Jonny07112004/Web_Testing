# Web_Testing
Overview

This repository is a hands-on Web Application Penetration Testing Lab focused on identifying, exploiting, and documenting common web security vulnerabilities. The project follows real-world penetration testing methodologies and aligns with the OWASP Top 10 to demonstrate practical offensive security skills.

It is designed for learning, experimentation, and showcasing penetration testing capabilities in a controlled and ethical environment.

# Objectives

Understand real-world web attack vectors

Perform manual and automated vulnerability assessments

Exploit common web application flaws safely

Document findings with remediation strategies

Build a strong portfolio for cybersecurity roles

# Scope of Testing

Web applications (intentionally vulnerable labs)

REST APIs (where applicable)

Authentication & authorization mechanisms

Session handling and access control

Note: No real-world or unauthorized systems are tested.

# Vulnerabilities Covered

SQL Injection (Error-based, Union-based, Blind)

Cross-Site Scripting (Stored, Reflected, DOM)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Broken Authentication

Broken Access Control (IDOR)

Security Misconfiguration

File Upload Vulnerabilities

Command Injection

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
