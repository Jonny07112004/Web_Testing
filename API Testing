API Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Discovery

To begin API security testing, the first and most critical step is to gather as much information as possible about the target API. This process, commonly referred to as API reconnaissance, helps identify the API’s attack surface—the set of exposed endpoints, methods, parameters, and behaviors that may be vulnerable to exploitation.

A thorough understanding of the API allows testers to:

Map all available endpoints and HTTP methods

Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms

Discover hidden, undocumented, or deprecated endpoints

Understand request/response structures and data flows

Detect misconfigurations and insecure design patterns

Key Reconnaissance Areas

API Documentation Analysis (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Endpoint Enumeration (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

Authentication & Token Handling (API keys, JWT, OAuth)

Parameter & Input Validation

Rate Limiting & Throttling Controls

Versioning & Deprecated Endpoints

Error Handling & Information Disclosure

By systematically enumerating and analyzing these components, you establish a clear foundation for effective API penetration testing and can prioritize high-risk areas for deeper security assessment.
